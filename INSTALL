=========== SHOP - advanced example of Limb3 based application ===========

Shop example includes:
1) Admin control panel
2) User authentication
3) Customer registration
4) Basic shop functionality including orders processing and tracking

To install shop example follow the steps below:

1) Unpack the archive in some directory that can be reached by your web-server, for example in /var/www/shop.
   (here we're assuming that /var/www directory can be accessed by your web-server as http://localhost)

2) Make /var/www/shop/var directory writable for the web server:

$ chmod 777 /var/www/shop/var

3) Configure application database.

  Using SQLite database
  ------------------------------
  shop application uses SQLite database by default. Make sure:
  a) You have enabled SQLite support in php.ini.
  b) Database itself and database directory are writable for web server:
  $ chmod 777 -R /var/www/shop/db

  Using MySQL database
  ------------------------------
  If you want to use MySQL as database then you need to create some database on MySQL server, e.g. "shop".

  Fill this database with a dump file shipped with shop application in init directory, e.g.:
  (assuming you have some valid database user 'user' with password 'secret')

  $mysql -u user -p secret shop < /var/www/shop/init/db.mysql

  To configure database settings for application you need to change /var/www/shop/settings/db.conf.php file , e.g.:

  <?php
  $conf = array('dsn' => 'mysql://user:secret@localhost/shop?charset=utf8');
  ?>

That is all.

Type in your favourite browser - http://localhost/shop/www

But you can also setup virtual host for this shop application:

1) Create shop VirtualHost in Apache config file(httpd.conf), something like this:

<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/shop/www/
    ServerName shop
    ErrorLog logs/shop-error_log
    CustomLog logs/shop-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

2) Put "shop" host name into /etc/hosts file(%WINDOWS%/system32/drivers/etc/hosts under Windows):

127.0.0.1  shop

3) Restart Apache

4) Open http://shop/ in your browser
